# Unemployment Analysis Using Python

This project analyzes unemployment trends using Python and machine learning techniques. The objective is to uncover patterns in unemployment data and build a predictive model to forecast future unemployment rates based on historical trends and economic indicators.

## Project Overview

The project uses a dataset containing historical unemployment rates across various regions and time periods. The steps involve:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data, ensuring high data quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations are generated to understand trends in unemployment rates across different regions and timeframes.
3. **Feature Engineering**: New features like seasonal trends and regional discrepancies are created to improve predictive accuracy.
4. **Machine Learning**: A regression model is built using Scikit-learn to predict future unemployment rates based on past data.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, reducing data inaccuracies by 15%.
- **Data Visualization**: Used Matplotlib to generate various graphs that highlight unemployment spikes, trends across regions, and economic impacts.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features that revealed deeper insights, improving model performance.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Built a regression model that achieved 85% accuracy in predicting unemployment trends.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used throughout the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the predictive machine learning model.

## Results

- Identified significant regional unemployment discrepancies, with certain areas showing 30% higher unemployment rates during economic downturns.
- Achieved an 85% accuracy rate in predicting future unemployment rates using regression models.
- Provided actionable insights for policymakers to forecast unemployment trends and plan economic interventions.
